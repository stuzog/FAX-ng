You can also hit the S key on your keyboard to do the same thing. If you close the sidebar, it will remain closed the next time you open the book. 1.2.2 Search The second button on the toolbar is the search button, keyboard shortcut F (Find). Click the button to see a Search Box. As you type in the box, you will see only sections that match the search keyword. Use the Arrow Keys [Up/Down] to highlight the previous/next match in the search results. Click the Search Button again (or hit F outside the Search Box). The search keyword will be emptied and the search box will be hidden. 1.2.3 Theme settings The third button on the toolbar is for Font/Theme settings. You can: Change the font size (bigger/smaller), the font family (serif/sans serif), and the theme (White, Sepia, or Night). 1.2.4 Downloads The icon for the Download Button lets you download files. Downloadable file types (PDF, EBOOK) are displayed in a drop-down menu. Click the type of file you want. If more than one file of that type is available, they will be shown. Click the specific file or [ALT/OPTION + CLICK] to select more than one. 1.2.5 Sharing On the right of the toolbar are buttons to share the link on social network websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin. 1.2.6 Information The Information Button (‘i’) lists keyboard shortcuts available to navigate the document.

Tap Share logs at the very bottom of Settings in FAX-ng. This will create two log files, log.txt and log_prev.txt, and open a screen allowing you to Share them by a variety of methods. Save these files on your Mac in a Folder of your choice. Leave the Folder window open on your Desktop. 4.2 Setting UAMSMB/SMB Limitations 4.2.1 Safety Limiters The following Settings act as “safety limiters”: Max UAMSMB Basal Minutes Max SMB Basal Minutes Autosens Max Autosens Min They do they not affect the calculations except by putting up fences. The primary focus on a new setup is to have initial Settings so that the system is immediately able to function adequately using its default calculations. But if your Basal Minutes is set to 30 and your Basal Rate is .1, and the app wants to give you an SMB of 2U, the Basal Minutes setting will limit it to .5U at a time, and your blood sugar will be high forever. So you will want to increase Basal Minutes to a value that allows the algorithm to do its job. The ideal is to create Settings that allow 95% of any UAMSMB/SMB calculation made by FAX-ng to influence insulin delivery. For this we need to ensure that: SMB is not limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes SMB is not limited by maxSMBBasalMinutes Dynamic ISF limited by autosens_max setting: 1.3 (1.3) To understand SMB and its limitations factors, you can read: Understanding Super Micro Bolus (SMB) in the OpenAPS documentation. 4.2.2 Open Terminal on Your Mac The Terminal application is in Applications —&gt; Utilities —&gt; Terminal 4.2.2.1 SHORTCUT to open Terminal Click on the Desktop in Finder Hold [SHIFT+OPTION+U] keys down together Press [RETURN] or [ENTER] Start typing terminal when the window opens Double-click the now-selected Terminal application to open it 4.2.2.2 Change to the Log File Directory Type cd [SPACE] in Terminal Switch to Finder Drag the small Folder icon where you saved the log files, into the Terminal window Press [ENTER/RETURN]. This will change Terminal to the log file directory. You can type ls then [RETURN] or [ENTER] to list them. The commands given below will now work correctly. 4.2.3 Find and Compare The Ratio of SMB-Limited Lines First, find find the total number of lines from the log pertinent to each. Copy and paste the first line of each command (below), after the $ prompt. The first line is the command, the second the returned result: grep maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes log.txt | grep limited | wc -l 114 Then find the number of lines that are SMB-limited: grep maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes log.txt | grep &quot;SMB limited&quot; | wc -l 57 Compare the two results. If the number of limited lines is more than 5% (in the above examples it obviously is), you need to adjust maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes, guided by these log reports. Sort the result by calculated units (the last value on the line): grep maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes log.txt | grep &quot;SMB limited&quot; | sort -n +20 Scroll through the search results to see how much the algorithm is limiting insulin delivery. The overall idea is to “ignore” the extreme SMBs. If the latter accounts for less than 5% of all lines, then don’t change your settings. In the log file, you will see lines similar to: DEV: JavaScript log: SMB is not limited by MaxUAMSMBBasalMinutes. ( insulinReq: 0.53U ) DEV: JavaScript log: SMB limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes [ 60m ]: 1.5U ( 6.28U ) There will be entries for both maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes and maxSMBBasalMinutes Optimally, you want to have more “not limited” lines then limited, with limited being limited to less then 5% of all of the lines. If you need to adjust maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes to reduce the percentage of lines that are limited, look for the line that represents about the mid-way of limited values. For example, if you have something like: DEV: JavaScript log: SMB limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes [ 60m ]: 1.5U ( 6.28U ) DEV: JavaScript log: SMB limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes [ 60m ]: 1.5U ( 5.72U ) DEV: JavaScript log: SMB limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes [ 60m ]: 1.5U ( 6.1U ) Use the entry with 6.1U as your adjustment point, with the formula: 60m * ( 6.1 / 1.5 ) = 240 And use the rounded results for your new value in maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes. Do the maths and up your UAMSMB basal minutes by that amount. For example: the algorithm bolused 1U insulin when it says it really wanted to bolus 3U, so increase UAMBasalMinutes by 3x in Settings. If you need to adjust, there are going to be more lines then the above to work with, but the value in parenthesis is what the system has calculated you require in the way of insulin, and the value outside is the limit BASED ON BasalMinutes. The 1.5U will vary depending on time of day, as its determined by your Basal Rate at the time of calculation. When you make the change, give it 24 hours before checking and adjusting again. 4.2.4 An Easier Way for the Rest of Us Here’s a much easier way for non-technical people: * Email log files to yourself * Open log_prev.txt * Press [CONTROL/COMMAND] + F to perform a search * Enter e.g. SMB is limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes into the Search field. * Press [RETURN/ENTER] Search for either “is limited” or “is not limited” to get the numbers for both. If the [“limited”]/[“is not limited”] x 100 is less than 5 (5%), then don’t change anything. 4.2.5 Checking The Results To check this (except the first day or so), run the above commands on the log_prev.txt file, which reports the previous 24-hour period. Leave it run for a full day before rechecking. If everything else is set up correctly for you, these SMB maximums won’t be needed in the future. But now you can know for sure that they are based on the results returned in your log files. "],["adjustmentfactor-autosens.html", "5 AdjustmentFactor (AutoSens) 5.1 Ballpark Formula", " 5 AdjustmentFactor (AutoSens) AdjustmentFactor is a multiplier that impacts insulin delivery. It determines the aggressiveness of the DynamicISF algorithm, and it tends to be person-specific. Basically, it’s determining how sensitive/resistant you are compared to your baseline. An AutoSens value of 1 means that your sensitivity is what the system expects. More than 1 means that you’re needing more insulin than your baseline; less than 1 means you are currently more sensitive and need less insulin The default is set at 1, which means that there is no change from those Settings values that affect insulin delivery. A full explanation of AutoSens can found in the OpenAPS documentation. 5.1 Ballpark Formula There is a formula for deriving an approximate number to begin with: adjustmentFactor = 277700/TDD * BG_target * (18 * 18) * StaticISF In Settings -&gt; Debug Options -&gt; TDD Averages there are numbers for: * Weighted Average (e.g. 78.75) * BG_Target (your choice e.g. 5.5) In Settings -&gt; Insulin Sensitivities: * StaticISF Use the Autotune value (e.g. 2.31) Using these example numbers, the AdjustmentFactor will be: 277700 / ( 2.31 * 78.75 * 5.5 * ( 18 * 18 ) * 2.31) = 0.856 It isn’t 100%, but it gets you into the ballpark range, and you can tweak up or down from there. "],["bolusing-for-meals.html", "6 Bolusing for Meals 6.1 Rule-of-Thumb Meal Bolusing 6.2 Let FAX-ng Do Its Work", " 6 Bolusing for Meals FreeAPS (FAX) doesn’t actually give meal bolus recommendations as does Loop. Here’s what the Meals section of LoopAndLearn FreeAPS docs recommends: The function Ivan has built to give a bolus is not a bolus calculator in the same way as Loop has one, so don’t expect it to give you enough insulin. What Ivan has done is to take the insulinReq calculation and use it to provide a bolus estimate. The insulinReq value is calculated based on a number of prediction curves, and when carbs are added, it mediates the effect of carbs with the other curves. So the insulinReq value is not necessarily as much insulin as the normal meal bolus would be (it’s conservative for safety reasons). It’s not a bolus calculator. The recommendation with oref1 (and the way most people use it) is to bolus 60%-75% of required meal bolus and leave the algorithm to deal with variation in absorption. 6.1 Rule-of-Thumb Meal Bolusing Rather than pull out a calculator, one pre-bolus strategy might be to form a little scale for yourself like the following. You should form your own based on your needs and Carb Ratio (CR): Small meal, 20g or less = 2U Med meal, 20g – 40g = 3U Large meal, 40g or more = 4U Your scale should be based upon your carb ratio and the % of upfront bolus that you prefer. For example, with a Carb Ratio of 10, the above meal boluses would provide a: * 100% upfront bolus for 20g * 75% upfront bolus for 40g, and * 67% upfront bolus for 60g 6.2 Let FAX-ng Do Its Work With an appropriate pre-bolus and Settings, you should NOT need to issue manual boluses after your meal. This may be a difficult task coming from Loop! If you used automatic bolus with Loop or the FreeAPS fork, you’ll find Temp Basal a little slower than you are used to, but it’s worth taking the time to test and adjust your settings before you turn on SMB/UAM. Observe for a few days and make adjustments as needed so that you won’t have to issue correction meal boluses. (Thanks to LoopAndLearn for this.)
