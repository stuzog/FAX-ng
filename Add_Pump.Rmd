# Add Pump

## If You Are Updgrading From FreeAPS X
**Only one pump at a time** can be controlled by *FreeAPS-X* or *FAX-ng*, so to add a pump to a new setup you must first *Disable OrangeLink/RileyLink* in the old pump setup.
 
## If You Are Upgrading From Loop to FAX-ng
**ATTENTION: You must FIRST disconnect RileyLink/OrangeLink/EmaLink from *Loop.app* BEFORE trying to connect a new Omnipod to *FAX-ng*.**

At a scheduled or unscheduled Omnipod change:

***While in Loop***

* Tap *Replace Pod* BEFORE disconnecting your RileyLink
	- *Settings —> OmniPod* screen
	- (Also available from *Pump/Pod icon* in Loop top Header)
* Turn RileyLink switch OFF
	- RileyLink *Green LED* will turn off
* Close the Loop App
	- *Swipe Up* Loop icon on *Home Screen* 

***Back in FAX-ng***

* Select *Omnipod* in *Settings —> Pump*
	- RileyLink should be recognised immediately
	- *Turn RileyLink ON*
* Fill a new pump or OmniPod, attach to body
	- *Start New Pod*

## Close Loop
